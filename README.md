I used OpenSCAD to design and 3D-print an enclosure for my Atomic PI - after
creating a USB2.0 adapter board for it. I wrote a [detailed blog post](https://www.thanassis.space/atomicpi-usb2.html) describing the process .

The two OpenSCAD files I created are stored in this repository.

My previous articles on this excellent 35$ SBC:

<li>Powering it up with a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thanassis.space/atomicpi.html">custom adapter of my own making</a>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thanassis.space/remotepower.html">Using an ESP01/relay module</a> to remotely power on/off my AtomicPI and interact with its serial port.
</ul>

Hope you find this useful!
